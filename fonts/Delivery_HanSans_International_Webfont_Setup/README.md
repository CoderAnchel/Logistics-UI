# DHL Font Stack

The actual `Delivery` font family should always be declared first. It covers the basic western unicode range, greek, coptic, cyrillic, Arabic and should always be used to corrosponding characters. If there is no match for a certain character, only then should the text be rendered using the Simplified Chinese, Japanese and Korean Subsets of `SourceHanSans`, renamed as Delivery to automatically be applied without further CSS changes.
